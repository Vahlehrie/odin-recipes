<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This crockpot butter chicken is one of my favorite Indian dishes. My friend made this dish for my family, and we were head over heels! I don't think I've had butter chicken that I've liked more. It's wonderful to put it into the slow cooker in the morning and come home to the aroma of warm Indian spices... I love it! Serve with basmati rice and warm naan bread.</p>
